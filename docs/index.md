## About Me
I'm a Java Server-Side-EngineerüöÄ, focusing on **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **System Design** (Kafka, Event Sourcing, etc.), **DevOps** (CI/CD, Toggle System, etc.), and **Developer Experience** (Backstage). When I'm not coding, you‚Äôll find me playing my guitar or piano and singing japanese songs.
